# Tempo Classroom

Per David, I'm updating README here with some context that I sent in an email when I originally submitted this for review on April 14th (same day you sent it over.)

PDF says attach as ZIP, but Gmail is giving me shit for attaching a ZIP that has certain file extensions inside, so here's a link to the GH repo: https://github.com/paulmederos/tempo-classroom (yes, it's public for now, I'll take it down / make it private if you prefer.)

Few notes:
- Made with CRA, so pull the repo down, nvm into node 13.3, get that `yarn install` off, then `yarn start` should get you up and running. Happy to deploy somewhere static if that's easier.
- Tried to keep it as close to 2hrs as possible, so there's a lot left undone (especially around UX) that normally I'd polish—but hey—this is supposed to be a conversation starter 😊 
- Can't wait to chat -- there's always so many little decisions, and the guiding philosophies/principles that direct those decisions.

Let me know if this works, or if just one glance at the code is enough for you to toss me on the "never hire" list 😂  I'm relatively booked until Friday, so happy to schedule a chat then, or early next week.

✌️,
Paul
